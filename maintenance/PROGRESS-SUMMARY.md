## Current Progress

- 39/39 components migrated (100%)
- 100% of directory structure created
- 100% of main index files created
- 100% of navigation configured
- 100% of content in English

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Component Updates:**
   - [ ] Update the remaining migrated components following the pattern of already updated components
   - [ ] Adjust component documentation to the new import paths
   - [ ] Include version variables
   - [✅] Ensure all content is in English

2. **Path Updates:**
   - [ ] Check and update all internal links
   - [ ] Update code examples to reflect the new import paths
   - [ ] Adjust all references to components

3. **Build and Tests:**
   - [ ] Local testing of the documentation with `npm run docs:dev`
   - [ ] Fix rendering issues
   - [ ] Final build with `npm run docs:build`

4. **CSS Optimization:**
   - [ ] Adjust CSS imports when the package is correctly installed
   - [ ] Optimize the custom CSS file for the new structure

## Current Challenges

- During migration, the already updated components were overwritten and had to be restored
- CSS imports were temporarily commented out in `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` to avoid build problems
- The Rollup configuration was adjusted to better handle external dependencies

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (completed)**: Structure and navigation adaptation
- **Phase 2 (in progress)**: Component migration (completed) and component update (in progress)
- **Phase 3 (planned)**: Content updates and quality improvements
- **Phase 4 (planned)**: Tests, build and finalization

## Recommendations for Next Actions

1. **Create Documentation Template**: Create a template for component documentation that can serve as a basis for updating the remaining components
2. **Batch Processing for Common Changes**: Create a script to automatically make common changes such as adding the version variable in all files
3. **Insert Version Variable**: Include the version variable in all component files
4. **Update Import Paths**: Update the import paths in all component files to the new structure

## Notes

- CSS imports were temporarily commented out in `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` to avoid build problems
- The Rollup configuration was adjusted to better handle external dependencies
- All documentation is now in English, as per requirements

## Open Questions

- Should examples for modular use of components be added?
- How should legacy links be handled? (Redirect or error message)
- Should a migration guide be created for users upgrading from version 0.5.5?
