1. **Title and Introduction**
   - Clear component/feature name
   - Brief description of purpose and use cases
   - Visual example (if applicable)

2. **Basic Usage**
   - Simple implementation example with code
   - Essential properties/classes explanation

3. **Variants and Options**
   - Document all supported variants (size, style, state)
   - Each with code examples and visual demos

4. **Advanced Usage Examples**
   - Real-world usage scenarios
   - Common patterns and best practices

5. **Technical Reference**
   - Import instructions
   - CSS variables and customization options
   - API reference (if applicable)

6. **Additional Information**
   - Accessibility considerations
   - Browser compatibility
   - Performance notes
   - Related components/features

## Component Documentation Template

Use the template in `documentation-template.md` as a starting point for all component documentation. This ensures consistency across the documentation.

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. **Clear and Concise**
   - Use simple, direct language
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary
   - Explain technical terms when first introduced

2. **Consistency**
   - Use consistent terminology throughout
   - Follow the naming conventions of the library
   - Maintain consistent headings and structure

3. **Code Examples**
   - Provide complete, working examples
   - Include comments for complex code
   - Use consistent formatting for all code blocks

4. **Visual Examples**
   - Include visual examples for all components and effects
   - Ensure examples demonstrate the feature clearly
   - Use screenshots or interactive demos where appropriate

## Documentation Process

1. **Research Phase**
   - Examine the component's CSS source
   - Identify all features, variants, and options
   - Test the component to understand its behavior

2. **Drafting Phase**
   - Create the initial documentation following the template
   - Include all identified features and options
   - Add placeholder examples

3. **Enhancement Phase**
   - Add comprehensive examples
   - Include edge cases and advanced usage
   - Document accessibility considerations

4. **Review Phase**
   - Check for technical accuracy
   - Ensure all examples work correctly
   - Verify all links and references

## File Naming and Organization

- Use kebab-case for all filenames
- Place component documentation in `/docs/components/[component-name]/index.md`
- Place effect documentation in `/docs/effects/[effect-type]/[effect-name].md`
- Place system documentation in `/docs/guide/[system-name].md`

## Images and Assets

- Store component-specific images in `/docs/public/images/components/[component-name]/`
- Use descriptive filenames for all images
- Optimize images for web (compress, use appropriate format)
- Include alt text for all images in markdown

## Accessibility Documentation

For each component, include:

1. **Keyboard Interactions**
   - Tab order
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Focus behavior

2. **Screen Reader Support**
   - ARIA roles and attributes
   - Semantic HTML considerations
   - Announcements and live regions

3. **Visual Accessibility**
   - Color contrast requirements
   - Text size and readability
   - Motion and animation concerns

## Versioning and Updates

- Note the version of the library the documentation applies to
- Clearly mark deprecated features
- Update documentation when the library changes
- Maintain a changelog for significant documentation updates

## Quality Checklist
