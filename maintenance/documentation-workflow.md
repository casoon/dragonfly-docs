# Documentation Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for updating and maintaining the English documentation for the `@casoon/ui-lib` design system.

## Overview

The documentation workflow consists of the following phases:

1. **Analysis**: Determine what needs to be documented or updated
2. **Planning**: Prioritize and assign documentation tasks
3. **Creation**: Write or update the documentation
4. **Review**: Ensure quality and accuracy
5. **Publication**: Publish the documentation
6. **Maintenance**: Keep the documentation up-to-date

## Detailed Workflow

### 1. Analysis Phase

**Objective**: Determine what needs to be documented or updated.

**Steps**:

1. **Version Check**
   - Compare the current version of `@casoon/ui-lib` with the documented version
   - Identify new or changed components, effects, or systems

2. **Component Analysis**
   - Extract all exports from `@casoon/ui-lib`
   - Check against existing documentation to identify gaps

3. **Documentation Audit**
   - Review existing documentation for quality and completeness
   - Identify areas that need improvement

**Tools**:
- Node.js script to compare package versions
- Component extraction script
- Documentation audit checklist

### 2. Planning Phase

**Objective**: Prioritize documentation tasks and create a plan.

**Steps**:

1. **Task Prioritization**
   - Prioritize documentation for new components
   - Prioritize updates for changed components
   - Prioritize improvements for high-traffic documentation

2. **Task Assignment**
   - Assign documentation tasks to team members
   - Set deadlines for completion

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Allocate time and resources for documentation
   - Ensure access to necessary tools and environments

**Tools**:
- `tasks.md` file for tracking tasks
- Project management tool (optional)
- Documentation calendar

### 3. Creation Phase

**Objective**: Create or update documentation according to the plan.

**Steps**:

1. **Research**
   - Study the component or feature being documented
   - Explore its functionality, options, and use cases
   - Examine the source code to understand implementation details

2. **Drafting**
   - Use the documentation template as a starting point
   - Create a complete first draft covering all aspects
   - Include code examples and visual demonstrations

3. **Enhancement**
   - Add comprehensive examples
   - Include edge cases and advanced usage
   - Ensure all sections are complete and detailed

**Tools**:
- Documentation template
- Component source code
- Local development environment for testing examples

### 4. Review Phase

**Objective**: Ensure documentation quality and accuracy.

**Steps**:

1. **Self-Review**
   - Check for technical accuracy
   - Verify all examples work correctly
   - Ensure all sections of the template are completed

2. **Peer Review**
   - Have another team member review the documentation
   - Check for clarity, completeness, and correctness
   - Verify against the quality checklist

3. **Technical Verification**
   - Test all code examples in a live environment
   - Verify browser compatibility information
   - Check all links and references

**Tools**:
- Quality checklist
- Test environment
- Review feedback form

### 5. Publication Phase

**Objective**: Publish the documentation to make it available to users.

**Steps**:

1. **Final Check**
   - Review once more for any issues
   - Check formatting and layout

2. **Version Tagging**
   - Tag the documentation with the version of the library it applies to
   - Update version information in relevant files

3. **Publication**
   - Merge documentation changes to the main branch
   - Deploy the documentation website
   - Verify the published documentation is accessible and correct

**Tools**:
- Git for version control
- CI/CD pipeline for deployment
- Post-deployment verification checklist

### 6. Maintenance Phase

**Objective**: Keep the documentation up-to-date and relevant.

**Steps**:

1. **Regular Audits**
   - Periodically review all documentation for accuracy
   - Check for outdated information or broken links
   - Identify areas that need improvement

2. **User Feedback**
   - Collect and analyze user feedback
   - Address common questions or issues in the documentation
   - Improve documentation based on user needs

3. **Version Updates**
   - Monitor for new releases of the library
   - Update documentation to reflect changes
   - Archive documentation for older versions if necessary

**Tools**:
- Documentation audit schedule
- User feedback system
- Version monitoring script

## Automating the Workflow

Parts of this workflow can be automated to improve efficiency:

1. **Version Checking**
   - Automatic notification when a new version is detected
   - Script to identify new or changed components

2. **Documentation Scaffolding**
   - Automatic generation of documentation templates for new components
   - Placeholder creation based on component structure

3. **Example Testing**
   - Automated testing of code examples
   - Validation of HTML/CSS examples

4. **Link Checking**
   - Regular checking for broken links
   - Automatic notification of issues

## Collaboration Guidelines

When multiple people are working on documentation:

1. **Coordination**
   - Use the `tasks.md` file to track who is working on what
   - Regular check-ins to avoid duplication of effort

2. **Consistency**
   - Follow the documentation guide for style and structure
   - Use the provided templates for all new documentation

3. **Reviews**
   - All documentation should be reviewed by at least one other person
   - Use pull requests for major documentation changes

4. **Communication**
   - Discuss significant changes or approaches
   - Share learnings and best practices

## Success Metrics

Track the following metrics to measure documentation quality:

1. **Completeness**
   - Percentage of components fully documented
   - Coverage of features within each component

2. **Quality**
   - Number of issues or errors found during review
   - User feedback scores

3. **Timeliness**
   - Time from library update to documentation update
   - Response time for documentation improvement requests

4. **Usage**
   - Documentation page views
   - Time spent on documentation pages
   - Most/least viewed documentation
