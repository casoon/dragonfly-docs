## Using with AI Tools (Model Context Protocol â€“ MCP)

To simplify development with casoon/ui-lib, your editor or AI tool (e.g., Cursor or Continue) can automatically load contextual information about the project â€“ including code, structure, and documentation.

This uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

ðŸ”§ **Configuration (e.g., for Cursor)**
Add the following configuration to your cursor.config.json or settings.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitmcp-ui-lib": {
      "url": "https://gitmcp.io/casoon/ui-lib"
    },
    "gitmcp-ui-docs": {
      "url": "https://gitmcp.io/casoon/ui-docs"
    }
  }
}
```

ðŸ“Œ **Explanation**
- **gitmcp-ui-lib**: Provides structural information about the component library itself (source code, props, imports, etc.).
- **gitmcp-ui-docs**: Provides information from the accompanying VitePress documentation (e.g., examples, variants, slots).

âœ… **Advantage**
With this configuration, an AI assistant can better understand your project and help more effectively with:

- Using components with the correct props
- Creating snippets based on real examples
- Understanding the architecture of your project
