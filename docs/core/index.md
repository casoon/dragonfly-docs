# Core System

The Core System of the Casoon UI Library forms the foundation for all components and styles. It defines the basic principles and structures on which the entire design system is built.

## Overview

The Core System consists of several key components:

- **Layer System**: Organization of CSS layers for optimal specificity and maintainability
- **CSS Architecture**: Structuring and organization of CSS code
- **Color System**: Color system and management
- **Color-Mix System**: Advanced color mixing and manipulation
- **Logical Properties**: Use of logical properties for language-independent layout
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implementation of smooth scrolling for better user experience

## Philosophy

The Core System follows these design principles:

1. **Modularity**: Independent, reusable components
2. **Consistency**: Unified design language
3. **Flexibility**: Adaptability to different requirements
4. **Performance**: Optimized performance with minimal file size
5. **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards

## Usage

The components of the Core System are automatically loaded when you import the main file of the Casoon UI Library:

```css
@import '@casoon/ui-lib/core.css';
```

For more specific requirements, you can import individual parts of the Core System separately.
