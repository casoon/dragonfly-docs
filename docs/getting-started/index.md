# Getting Started

Welcome to Casoon UI, a modern CSS framework designed to help you build beautiful, accessible, and responsive user interfaces. This guide will help you understand the core concepts.

## Introduction

Casoon UI is a modular CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of components, utilities, and design tokens for building modern web interfaces. The library is designed with accessibility, performance, and customization in mind.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with Casoon UI is through npm:

```bash
npm install @casoon/ui-lib
```

For other installation methods, see the [Installation guide](./installation).

## Basic Usage

After installation, you can import the entire library or just the parts you need:

```js
// Import the entire library
import '@casoon/ui-lib/dist/styles.css';

// Or import specific modules
import '@casoon/ui-lib/core.css';
import '@casoon/ui-lib/ui.css';
import '@casoon/ui-lib/effects.css';
```
